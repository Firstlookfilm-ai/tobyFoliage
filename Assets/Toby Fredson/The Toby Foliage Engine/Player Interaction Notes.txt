 * Simple Player Interaction

 Shader interaction with touch bedding animation. Works with any prefab as well as with terrain plants. It can be switched between multiple players.

 X Limitations: Support only one interactor at a time.


 * Physics Interaction

 Works with an unlimited number of interactors at the same time.

 X Limitations: Doesn't work on terrain objects as the terrain has its own collision system that is different from the default mesh.

 - As a quick workaround, you can use the "Convert Terrain to Prefab" script to transform terrain plants into prefabs. This tool creates a clone of the terrain plants as prefabs without being destructive. It is not recommended for extremely large terrains, proceed with caution as it might requier computing power! -
